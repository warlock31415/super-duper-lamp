This repo contains files for building a single direction traffic control unit using discrete logic. 

The circuit uses a 555 timer to generate a 1Hz signal which increments a BCD counter. The outputs from the counter are fed into logic gates
to ensure that the correct light is turned on. The green and red lights1 thus turn on for 6 seconds individually. And the yellow light turns 
on for 4 seconds.
